This plugin does not work anymore because <a href="https://spectrum.chat/figma-plus/general/thank-you-and-good-bye~ef95c63c-b8e1-4885-8404-d8bf08fdb1d0">Figma Plus was discontinued</a>.  Once Figma releases their official extensions API, I will migrate this plugin to work there.  Sorry for the inconvenience.
